# bolt-trading

Welcome to bolt-trading, this is an educational service that teaches people how to trade.
bolt-trading offers it's services through a private discord group where teachers share resources into the group. In this repository, you'll find 4 separate html pages that make up this website.

My inspiration for this project was freetrade and stocksniper, freetrade website is a very colourful and vibrant website so I made sure that the colour scheme would replicate a similar feeling and stocksniper had the relevant information I needed to build the website. These were my blueprint, the UI helped my decide how I wanted my website to be structed.
